                <li>Sushi.
           <hr>
            Sushi is the most famous Japanese dish and the first thing people think of when they think of Japanese 
            cuisine. For sushi connoisseurs, it's more than just food. It's an art form. Sushi refers to a family of artfully presented dishes made with vinegared sushi rice and a variety of ingredients, mostly raw fish and other types of seafood. It can be made with any type of fresh raw fish, some of the most popular being maguro (tuna), shake (salmon), hamachi (yellowtail), saba (mackerel), and unagi (freshwater eel).
            Sushi is commonly eaten with pickled ginger and dipped in soy sauce mixed with wasabi. </li>

            <li>Sashimi
            <hr>
                Sashimi refers to thinly sliced raw fish or seafood. It can even refer to different types of raw meat. It's basically sushi minus the vinegared rice. Like sushi, 
                it's usually eaten with soy sauce mixed with wasabi.</li>

            <li>Ramen 
                <hr>
                Like sushi, ramen is a Japanese food favorite and one of the best dishes you can eat in Japan. It refers to a noodle soup made with four basic components - the broth, tare (seasoning), wheat noodles, and toppings.
                Tare (or kaeshi) is the salty concentrated essence placed at the bottom of every ramen bowl. Together with the broth, it's what determines the style of the ramen, of which there are four main types - shoyu, miso, shio, and tonkotsu. 
                The noodles and toppings enhance the experience but the true star of this beloved Japanese dish is the seasoned broth.</li>

                <li>Tempura 
                    <hr> Tempura is a traditional Japanese cooking method that involves deep-frying seafood or vegetables coated in a light batter made with cold water and soft cake flour. 
                    The tempura batter is lightly mixed and kept cold with lumps to create a crisp and fluffy texture when fried. 
                    Most tempura is cooked for just a few seconds before being served with grated daikon radish and a dipping sauce, 
                    most often tentsuyu which is made with dashi (soup stock), mirin (rice wine), and shoyu (soy sauce). Alternatively, 
                    it can be sprinkled with sea salt or mixtures of powdered green tea, salt, and yuzu before eating.

                <li>Unagi
                    <hr> Unagi is freshwater eel. It isn't to be confused with <a href="https://www.willflyforfood.net/the-ultimate-japanese-food-guide-what-to-eat-in-japan-and-where-to-try-them/#anago-meshi">unagi</a> which is saltwater or conger eel. 
                    To prepare unagi, the eel is cut open and its head and bones are removed. 
                    The meat is then skewered and broiled before being slowly grilled over charcoal 
                    while being basted with a kabayaki sauce (sweet soy sauce).
                    Grilled unagi is commonly served as sushi in Japan, or over a 
                    bed of rice in a dish called unagi donburi or unadon for short.</li>

                <li>Wagyu
                    <hr>
                    The term wagyu refers to any of the four Japanese breeds of cattle - namely Japanese Black, Japanese Brown, 
                    Japanese Polled, and Japanese Shorthorn. Any beef produced from these four breeds of cattle is known as wagyu, 
                    However, not all types of wagyu are equal. The most desired wagyu comes from Japanese cattle that's genetically predisposed to intense marbling, 
                    like the Tajima strain of cattle raised in Hyogo. 
                    You've probably heard of it as Kobe Beef.</li>

                    <li> Kushiyaki / Yakitori
                        <hr> Many non-Japanese have probably heard of the term “yakitori”, but not “kushiyaki”. Both refer to skewers of 
                        grilled meat popular at izakayas or informal Japanese gastropubs. 
                        Like oden, it's one of the most popular bar foods in Japan.
                        Strictly speaking, yakitori refers specifically to skewered and charcoal-grilled chicken, 
                        though it's often used to describe skewered meat in general, both poultry and non-poultry.
                        The proper blanket term to describe all types of skewered grilled meat in Japan is kushiyaki. 
                        Different types of meat and vegetables are skewered on bamboo or metal sticks before being grilled over charcoal
                        and seasoned with a tare sauce. It's one of the best Japanese dishes you can have with beer.</li>
