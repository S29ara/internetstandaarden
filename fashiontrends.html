        <h1>JAPANESE FASHION</h1>

        <h2>Japanese fashion trends 2022</h2>

        <h3>When you think of Japanese fashion and clothing, the first thing that comes to mind is probably the colorful Harajuku style
            that was trending in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Originating from the hip and happening Tokyo neighborhood of Harajuku, 
            this creative and hugely popular Japanese fashion trend gained world-wide fame.</h3>

        <h3>But what does the Japanese fashion scene look like in 2022? Is colorful apparel still in style, 
            or have trends changed? Let's have a look at what's popular in Japan today!</h3>

                <h4>Vintage clothes</h4>

                    <p>Environmentally friendly and a true treasure trove for people looking for something unique, 
                       second-hand clothing stores in Japan have become very popular over the last few years. Neighborhoods like Shimokitazawa, 
                       Koenji and Shibuya are home to countless vintage shops, sometimes with a special theme such as mid-20th century or old American fashion. 
                       Young, trendy people don't necessarily shop second-hand to save money - items often go for more than their original price tag - but simply want to put
                       together an outfit that is personal and one-of-a-kind. High end clothing brands also make for coveted vintage items, and some can even serve as an investment 
                       that doesn't lose its value.</p>

                       <h4>Oversized clothes</h4>
                       
                    <p>The average Japanese person has a rather slim build which lends itself perfectly for looking good in oversized fashion. 
                        Over the last decade, oversized clothing has become extremely trendy amongst everyone from teens to people well into their 30s. 
                        When you walk around a busy area like Shibuya, you will see plenty of baggy pants, long, voluminous skirts as well as oversized 
                        sweaters and t-shirts. Besides the fact that most Japanese are able to wear a larger size than needed while still looking good, 
                        dressing modestly has always been a theme in Japanese fashion. In fact, the traditional kimono was designed to be non-revealing 
                        and not show any curves. Today, many people still feel most comfortable in clothes that don't give away too much of what's underneath.</p>

                <h4>Plaid fashion</h4>

                <p>Plaid is traditionally part of traditional British school uniforms and has always been associated with religion and status. 
                The checkered pattern has also made it into many of Japan's high school uniforms and is therefore linked to an image of innocence and youth. 
                But even if you are already well past high school age, you can still wear plaid in Japan! Of course, one of the most common manifestations of plaid are the kawaii schoolgirl-style skirts, 
                but that's not the only way you will see this material used in Japanese fashion. Many young men like to wear colorful plaid pants, and then there are the popular oversized dresses made completely 
                from this material. Since its invention in the early 90s, Harajuku-style has evolved into many sub-styles, one of which heavily uses plaid. Creative young fashionistas make entire outfits from this material, 
                decking themselves out in plaid from hats to shoes.</p>
