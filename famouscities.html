             <li>Sapporo<hr>Sapporo is the largest city in Hokkaido, the northernmost prefecture of Japan. The average temperature in Sapporo is lower than that of Tokyo, 
                    and the average summer temperature is 26.4℃, making it a very cool place to avoid the hot and humid climate of the summer.
                    In winter, it gets very cold, and Hokkaido is proud of its gourmet foods such as ramen and soup curry, 
                    which are the most commonly eaten dishes there during the winter.

                    such as golf and jazz, to Japan, and because of the strong Western influence, the city itself has the exotic scent of a seaside town in 
                    some far off place. If you come here with your sweetheart, you will be enchanted by the elegance of the city, so why not visit?

                    Osaka in the Kansai region, Kyoto was the capital of Japan before the capital was moved to Tokyo. For this reason, 
                    the city of Kyoto has always been enveloped in an atmosphere of elegance, 
                    and there are numerous shrines and temples in the city, allowing visitors to fully enjoy the atmosphere that is uniquely

                    you can also taste delicious matcha sweets.

             <li>Hiroshima<hr>Hiroshima is a city rich in nature, blessed with the sea and mountains in Chugoku region, 
                    and since the atomic bomb was dropped on August 6th, 1945, it has been known as a peace-loving city. Although Hiroshima is a 
                    city of peace, it also has many beautiful traditional buildings. One good example is Itsukushima Shrine, famous for its vermilion torii 
                    (shrine gate) built over the sea. If you come to Hiroshima, be sure to try Hiroshima-style okonomiyaki, 
                    which has plenty of cabbage and noodles inside.

                    with a statue of Lord Date Masamune, the proud military commander of Sendai, and many zelkova trees planted in the city.
                    A 30-minute to 1-hour drive from Sendai to the suburbs will take you to the valleys and beautiful rivers of Akiu, Sakunami, 
                    and Izumi areas. You can enjoy cool nature in summer and beautiful autumn leaves in fall that will captivate all who see them. Sendai, with its abundance of nature,
