    <h2>History of Japan</h2>
    <section class="paragraaf-container">
       
        <p>The first human inhabitants of the Japanese archipelago have been traced to prehistoric times around 30,000 BC.
        The Jōmon period, named after its cord-marked pottery, was followed by the Yayoi period in the first millennium BC when new 
        inventions were introduced from Asia. During this period, the first known written reference to Japan was recorded in the Chinese 
        Book of Han in the first century AD.

        Around the 3rd century BC, 
        the Yayoi people from the continent immigrated to the Japanese archipelago and introduced iron technology and agricultural civilization.
        [1] Because they had an agricultural civilization, the population of the Yayoi began to grow rapidly and 
        ultimately overwhelmed the Jōmon people, natives of the Japanese archipelago who were hunter-gatherers.[2] Between the fourth to ninth century, 
        Japan's many kingdoms and tribes gradually came to be unified under a centralized government, 
        nominally controlled by the Emperor of Japan. The imperial dynasty established at this time continues to this day, 
        albeit in an almost entirely ceremonial role. In 794, a new imperial capital was established at Heian-kyō (modern Kyoto), 
        marking the beginning of the Heian period, 
        which lasted until 1185. The Heian period is considered a golden age of classical Japanese culture. 
        Japanese religious life from this time and onwards was a mix of native Shinto practices and Buddhism.</p>
